    "A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot-radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.",

    "If you move so an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends."
