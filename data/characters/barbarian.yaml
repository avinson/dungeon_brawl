   - name: Rage (2)
     description: |
      In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On Your Turn, you can enter a rage as a Bonus Action.

      While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

      • You have advantage on Strength Checks and Strength Saving Throws.
      • When you make a melee weapon Attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
      • You have Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

      Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked Unconscious or if Your Turn ends and you haven't attacked a Hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on Your Turn as a Bonus Action.

      While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.
