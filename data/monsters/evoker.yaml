     description: When the evoker casts an evocation spell that forces other creatures it can see to make a saving throw, it can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level. These creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell. If a successful save means a chosen creature would take half damage from the spell, it instead takes no damage from it.
