If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, unless it is immune to the frightened condition. Otherwise, a creature takes 16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn.

If the creature looks at the bodak in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw."
