  - name: "Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)"
    description: |
      The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

      A glabrezu has a 30 percent chance of summoning 1d3 vrocks, 1d2 hezrous, or one glabrezu.

      A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
