  - name: "Death Burst"
    description: |
      When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of jagged ice. Each creature within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

  - name: "False Appearance"
    description: |
      While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary shard of ice.

  - name: "Innate Spellcasting (1/Day)"
    description: |
      The mephit can innately cast fog cloud, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

  - name: "Frost Breath (Recharge 6)"
    description: |
      The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of cold air. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

  - name: "Variant: Summon Mephits (1/Day)"
    description: |
      The mephit has a 25 percent chance of summoning 1d4 mephits of its kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
