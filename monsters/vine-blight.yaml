   - name: False Appearance
     description: While the blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a tangle of vines.
actions:
   - name: Constrict
     description: "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller target is grappled (escape DC 12) . Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the blight can't constrict another target."
   - name: Entangling Plants (Recharge 5-6)
     description: Grasping roots and vines sprout in a 15-foot radius centered on the blight, withering away after 1 minute. For the duration, that area is difficult terrain for nonplant creatures. In addition, each creature of the blight's choice in that area when the plants appear must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or become restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check, freeing it self or another entangled creature within reach on a success.
