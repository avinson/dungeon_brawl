special_abilities:
  - name: "Constructed Nature"
    description: |
      An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

  - name: "Antimagic Susceptibility"
    description: |
      The hut is incapacitated while the magic gem that animates it is in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the hut must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
