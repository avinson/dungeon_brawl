   - name: Animate Boulders (1/Day)
     description: The galeb duhr magically animates up to two boulders it can see within 60 ft. of it. A boulder has statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 and Charisma 1, it can't be charmed or frightened, and it lacks this action option. A boulder remains animated as long as the galeb duhr maintains concentration, up to 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell) .
