  - name: "Constructed Nature"
    description: |
      An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

      The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

      **Reactions**

  - name: "Animated Attack"
    description: |
      If the broom is motionless and a creature grabs hold of it, the broom makes a Dexterity check contested by the creature's Strength check. If the broom wins the contest, it flies out of the creature's grasp and makes a melee attack against it with advantage on the attack roll.
