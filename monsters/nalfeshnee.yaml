actions:
  - name: "Multiattack"
    description: |
      The nalfeshnee uses Horror Nimbus if it can.  It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

  - name: "Bite"
    description: |
      Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (5d10 + 5) piercing damage.

  - name: "Claw"
    description: |
      Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.

  - name: "Horror Nimbus (Recharge 5-6)"
    description: |
      The nalfeshnee magically emits scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee that can see the light must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.

  - name: "Teleport"
    description: |
      The nalfeshnee magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

  - name: "Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)"
    description: |
      The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

      A nalfeshnee has a 50 percent chance of summoning 1d4 vrocks, 1d3 hezrous, 1d2 glabrezus, or one nalfeshnee.

      A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
