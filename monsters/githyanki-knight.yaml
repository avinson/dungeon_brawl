    description: |
      The githyanki's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components: 

      At will: mage hand (the hand is invisible)

      1/day each: plane shift, telekinesis

  - name: "Multiattack"
    description: |
      The githyanki makes two silver greatsword attacks.

  - name: "Silver Greatsword"
    description: |
      Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage. This is a magic weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the astral projection spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
