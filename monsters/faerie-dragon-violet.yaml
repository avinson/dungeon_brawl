spell_casting:
  - name: "Innate Spellcasting"
    description: |
      The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast a number of spells, requiring no material components. As the dragon ages and changes color, it gains additional spells as shown below.

      1/day each: color spray, dancing lights, hallucinatory terrain, mage hand, major image, minor illusion, mirror image, polymorph, suggestion

  


actions:
  - name: "Bite"
    description: |
      Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage.

  - name: "Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5-6)"
    description: |
      The dragon exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:

      1-4. The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.

      5-6. The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
