  - name: "Blood Drain"
    description: |
      One creature in the vampiric mist's space must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw (undead and constructs automatically succeed). On a failed save, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the mist regains hit points equal to that amount.

      This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the target finishes a long rest. It dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
