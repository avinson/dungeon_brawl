      The ultroloth's eyes sparkle with opalescent light as it targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it.

      The yugoloth chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

      An ultroloth has a 50 percent chance of summoning 1d6 mezzoloths, 1d4 nycaloths, or one ultroloth.

      A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other yugoloths. The summoned yugoloth remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action to dismiss it.
